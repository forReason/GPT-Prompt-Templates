Create a c# class in order to serialize deserialize a json server response:
- Include xml comments? [yes]
- Include constructors? [no]
- Include functions to serialize/deserialize the response to string? [no]
- Include functions to save/load the json to disk with the extension ".response"? [no]
- IMPORTANT: properties inside the class should be named with [snake_case], eg `used_for_farmer_rewards`
- The class itself should be named in [PascalCase] format with [_Response] suffix eg `MyClass_Response`
- Exclude attributes such as [JsonPropertyName("wallet_id")] because I am working with System.Text.Json. The properties names should match the json *exactly*
- The class is a derivate of ResponseTemplate: [MyClass_Response : ResponseTemplate<MyClass_Response>]
- Lists should be implemented as arrays? [yes]
- Positive integers are likely of type: [ulong]
- Exclude the follwing properties, as they are already part of the Baseclass: [success],[error]
- Exclude the follwing functions, as they are already part of the Baseclass: [serialize],[deserialize]
- The base class is already present, omit it from your response
- Optional properties should be marked as nullable

Here is some further documentation about the server response (optional):
```
{Optional}
```

This is the original JSON response to serialize/deserialize:
```
{Mandatory}
```
