Create a c# class according to the following JSON server response:
- include xml comments [yes]
- include functions to serialize/deserialize the response to string [no]
- include functions to save/load the json to disk with the extension ".response" [no]
- IMPORTANT: property naming convention [snake_case], eg `public bool used_for_farmer_rewards { get; set; }`
- dont include `[JsonProperties]` as I am working with System.Text.Json
- if applicable use the classname from the original Documentation in [PascalCase] format
- Class Name Suffix: [_Response]
- Class naming example: [MyClass_Response : ResponseTemplate<MyClass_Response>]
