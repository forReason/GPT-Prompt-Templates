| Condition                                         | Action                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Falling behind early in the game                  | Focus on farm, avoid risky plays, and look for opportunities to scale and catch up |
| Teammate is performing poorly                     | Encourage and support them, focus on your own gameplay, and try to create opportunities for the team |
| Repeatedly getting caught out or ganked           | Analyze the situation, improve your vision control and positioning, and play more defensively |
| Enemy team is snowballing                         | Identify win conditions, prioritize objectives, and look for picks to stall the game |
| Team is arguing or blaming each other             | Defuse the situation, avoid engaging in arguments, and focus on teamwork and coordination |
| Feeling frustrated or tilted                      | Take a deep breath, reset your mindset, and refocus on the game. Remember that everyone has bad games, and it's important to learn from them |
| Tunnel vision (e.g., chasing low-health enemies)  | Evaluate the risks, consider enemy territory and potential reinforcements, and prioritize objectives over risky chases. Regularly ask yourself questions like "Why am I doing this?" or "What is the best course of action?" to maintain a clear mind |
| When you die or make mistakes                     | Reflect on the situation, identify what led to it, and avoid blaming teammates. Focus on learning from the mistake and ask yourself what you could have done differently |
| Taking breaks between games                       | Take short breaks to refresh your mind and maintain focus |
| Mindfulness techniques and mindfulness questions  | Practice breathing exercises, meditation, or take a moment to refocus. Ask yourself questions like "Why am I doing this?" or "What is the best course of action?" during the game to maintain a clear mind |
| Growth mindset and adaptability                   | Focus on improving your skills and doing your best instead of trying to win the game. Be open to trying new champions, builds, or runes when you feel stuck |
| Staying alive is a priority                       | Keep in mind that staying alive is crucial in most situations, as death timers can significantly impact your team's performance. Focus on minimizing risks and playing smart |
| Never surrender                                   | Focus on making it difficult for the enemy to win the game, even when behind. Use this as an opportunity to learn how to play from behind and improve your decision-making. Stay safe, defend turrets, farm efficiently to catch up, and consider item changes to adapt to the situation |
