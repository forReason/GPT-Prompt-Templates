Thoughts on how to buy/sell and offer files
Well, to post an offer to an exchange, you upload an offer file. Basically just the same as if you posted it in a forum.
Changing the offer afterwards is not possible. You can make a second offer and upload that one. Then you have two offers.
Somehow the exchange keeps track if your offer has been executed or canceled so that information needs to be stored somewhere on the blockchain.
For static prices like nfts, that works actually quite well. But for price fluctuating assets, it is suboptimal. I think a lot has to be changed for such things to happen. For everyday commodities, the offers are perfekt I think. Really allowing barter trades like nft vs nft and so on.

Finally, you refer to the instructions, pertinent details about the content, product, or other specific guidance, provided in the notes below:

Please write a new forum dev block entry for my coin BTF

The current state of the Software is the following:
- The portfolio rebalancer is up and running.
- Several stability issues have been resolved.
- Offer searching has been improved

The current state of the next development for providing statistics and reports:
- A converter Library for Portfolio performance tables has been created.
- With this library, csv files in PortfolioPerformance format can be generated
- I am now working on reading out all Transactions from all exchanges and merging them together to provide a full report.

As a mini report:
- The price so far is relatively stable
- the portfolio started at ~0.97 $ / 1 BTF. We are now at 1$ / 1 BTF
- so far, the portfolio is slowly fighting its way upwards.
